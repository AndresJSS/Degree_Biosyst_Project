# BSc. Degree Biosyst Project - Solar CFD and thermodynamic modeling ☀️

This repository contains some documentation related to my BSc degree final project.

- Video of one of the CFD simulation

### Problem description
In order to increase the efficiency of a anaerobic biodigester, an option is to build a biomass-solar radiation hybrid system. Solar radiation increases and maintains constant the temperature of the biodigester, avoiding energy feedback problems within the hybrid system. Concentrated solar energy systems represent a feasible option.

## What is in this repo?
* Some mechanical & structural design criteria considering the purpose of the solar receiver, operational conditions and materials.
* A meshing optimization study using Ansys Meshing.
* CFD modeling considering two types of working fluids and two mass flow.
* A thermodynamic modeling considering a Rankine cycle using Matlab.
